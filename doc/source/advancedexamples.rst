How to select hardware devices?
-------------------------------

Qibo supports execution on different hardware configurations including CPU with
multi-threading, single GPU and multiple GPUs. Here we provide some useful
information on how to control the devices that Qibo uses for circuit execution
in order to maximize performance for the available hardware configuration.

Switching between CPU and GPU
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If a GPU with CUDA support is available in the system and Tensorflow is installed
for CUDA then circuits will be executed on the GPU automatically unless the user
specifies otherwise. In order to force the device a circuit will be executed
one can use:

.. code-block::  python

    with tf.device("/CPU:0"):
        # execute circuit on CPU with default initial state |000...0>.
        final_state = c()

or switch the default Qibo device using ``qibo.set_device`` as:

.. code-block::  python

    import qibo
    qibo.set_device("/CPU:0")
    final_state = c() # circuit will now be executed on CPU

The syntax of device names follows the pattern ``'/{device type}:{device number}'``
where device type can be CPU or GPU and the device number is an integer that
distinguishes multiple devices of the same type starting from 0. For more details
we refer to `Tensorflow's tutorial <https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/gpu#manual_device_placement>`_
on manual device placement.
Alternatively, running the command ``CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=""`` in a terminal
hides GPUs from tensorflow. As a result, any program executed from the same
terminal will run on CPU even if ``tf.device`` is not used.

In most cases the GPU accelerates execution compared to CPU, however the
following limitations should be noted:
  * For small circuits (less than 10 qubits) the overhead from casting tensors
    on GPU may be larger than executing the circuit on CPU, making CPU execution
    preferrable. In such cases disabling CPU multi-threading may also increase
    performance (see next subsection).
  * A standard GPU has 12-16GB of memory and thus can simulate up to 30 qubits on
    single-precision or 29 qubits with double-precision when Qibo's default gates
    are used. For larger circuits one should either use the CPU (assuming it has
    more memory) or a distributed circuit configuration. The latter allows splitting
    the state vector on multiple devices and is useful both when multiple GPUs
    are available in the system or even for re-using a single GPU
    (see relevant subsection bellow).

Note that if the used device runs out of memory during a circuit execution an error will be
raised prompting the user to switch the default device using ``qibo.set_device``.

Setting the number of CPU threads
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Qibo inherits Tensorflow's defaults for CPU thread configuration and in most cases
will utilize all available CPU threads. For small circuits the parallelization
overhead may decrease performance making single thread execution preferrable.
Tensorflow allows restricting the number of threads as follows:

.. code-block::  python

    import tensorflow as tf
    tf.config.threading.set_inter_op_parallelism_threads(1)
    tf.config.threading.set_intra_op_parallelism_threads(1)
    import qibo

Note that this should be run during Tensorflow initialization in the beginning
of the script and before any circuit or gate allocation.

Using multiple GPUs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Qibo supports distributed circuit execution on multiple GPUs. This feature can
be used as follows:

.. code-block::  python

    from qibo.models import Circuit
    from qibo import gates

    # Define GPU configuration
    accelerators = {"/GPU:0": 3, "/GPU:1": 1}
    # this will use the first GPU three times and the second one time
    # leading to four total logical devices
    # construct the distributed circuit for 32 qubits
    c = Circuit(32, accelerators, memory_device="/CPU:0")

Gates can then be added normally using ``c.add`` and the circuit can be executed
using ``c()``. Note that a ``memory_device`` is passed in the distributed circuit
(if this is not passed the CPU will be used by default). This device does not perform
any gate calculations but is used to store the full state. Therefore the
distributed simulation is limited by the amount of CPU memory.

Also, note that it is possible to reuse a single GPU multiple times increasing the number of
"logical" devices in the distributed calculation. This allows users to execute
circuits with more than 30 qubits on a single GPU by reusing several times using
``accelerators = {"/GPU:0": ndevices}``. Such a simulation will be limited
by CPU memory only.

For systems without GPUs, the distributed implementation can be used with any
type of device. For example if multiple CPUs, the user can pass these CPUs in the
accelerator dictionary.

Distributed circuits are generally slower than using a single GPU due to communication
bottleneck. However for more than 30 qubits (which do not fit in single GPU) and
specific applications (such as the QFT) the multi-GPU scheme can be faster than
using only CPU.

For more details in the distributed implementation one can look in the related
code: :class:`qibo.tensorflow.distcircuit.TensorflowDistributedCircuit`. When
``models.Circuit`` is called then this distributed implementation is used automatically
if the ``accelerators`` dictionary is passed, otherwise the standard single device
:class:`qibo.tensorflow.circuit.TensorflowCircuit` is used.

Unlike the standard circuit, executing a
:class:`qibo.tensorflow.distcircuit.TensorflowDistributedCircuit` without
measurements will return a
:class:`qibo.tensorflow.distutils.DistributedState` instead of the final
state vector as a ``tf.Tensor``. This is done because the distributed circuit
uses the state partitioned in multiple pieces that are distributed to the
different devices. Creating the full state as a tensor would require merging
these pieces and using twice as much memory. This is disabled by default,
however the user may create the full state as follows:

.. code-block::  python

    # Create distributed circuits for two GPUs
    c = Circuit(32, {"/GPU:0": 1, "/GPU:1": 1})
    # Add gates
    c.add(...)
    # Execute (``final_state`` will be a ``DistributedState``)
    final_state = c()

    # Access the full state (will double memory usage)
    full_final_state = final_state.vector
    # ``full_final_state`` is a ``tf.Tensor``

    # ``DistributedState`` supports indexing and slicing
    print(final_state[40])
    # will print the 40th component of the final state vector
    print(final_state[20:25])
    # will print the components from 20 to 24 (inclusive)


How to use callbacks?
---------------------

Callbacks allow the user to apply additional functions on the state vector
during circuit execution. An example use case of this is the calculation of
entanglement entropy as the state propagates through a circuit. This can be
implemented easily using :class:`qibo.tensorflow.callbacks.EntanglementEntropy`
and the :class:`qibo.base.gates.CallbackGate` gate. For example:

.. code-block::  python

    from qibo import models, gates, callbacks
    # initialize circuit with 2 qubits and add gates
    c = models.Circuit(2) # state is |00> (entropy = 0)
    c.add(gates.CallbackGate(entropy)) # performs entropy calculation in the initial state
    c.add(gates.H(0)) # state is |+0> (entropy = 0)
    c.add(gates.CallbackGate(entropy)) # performs entropy calculation after H
    c.add(gates.CNOT(0, 1)) # state is |00> + |11> (entropy = 1))
    c.add(gates.CallbackGate(entropy)) # performs entropy calculation after CNOT

    # create entropy callback where qubit 0 is the first subsystem
    entropy = callbacks.EntanglementEntropy([0])
    # execute the circuit using the callback
    final_state = c()

The results can be accessed using indexing on the callback objects. In this
example ``entropy[:]`` will return ``tf.Tensor([0, 0, 1])`` which are the
values of entropy after every gate in the circuit.

The same callback object can be used in a second execution of this or a different
circuit. For example

.. code-block::  python

    # c is the same circuit as above
    # execute the circuit
    final_state = c()
    # execute the circuit a second time
    final_state = c()

    # print result
    print(entropy[:]) # tf.Tensor([0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1])

The callback for entanglement entropy can also be used on state vectors directly.
For example

.. code-block::  python

    import numpy as np
    # create a singlet state vector
    state = np.zeros(4)
    state[0], state[3] = 1 / np.sqrt(2), 1 / np.sqrt(2)

    # create an `EntanglementEntropy` callback object
    entropy = callbacks.EntanglementEntropy([0])
    # call the object on the state
    print(entropy(state))

will print ``tf.Tensor(1.0)``.

.. _params-examples:
How to use parametrized gates?
------------------------------

Some Qibo gates such as rotations accept values for their free parameter. Once
such gates are added in a circuit their parameters can be updated using the
:meth:`qibo.base.circuit.BaseCircuit.set_parameters` method. For example:

.. code-block::  python

    from qibo.models import Circuit
    from qibo import gates
    # create a circuit with all parameters set to 0.
    c = Circuit(3, accelerators)
    c.add(gates.RX(0, theta=0))
    c.add(gates.RY(1, theta=0))
    c.add(gates.CZ(1, 2))
    c.add(gates.fSim(0, 2, theta=0, phi=0))
    c.add(gates.H(2))

    # set new values to the circuit's parameters
    params = [0.123, 0.456, (0.789, 0.321)]
    c.set_parameters(params)

initializes a circuit with all gate parameters set to 0 and then updates the
values of these parameters according to the ``params`` list. Alternatively the
user can use ``circuit.set_parameters()`` with a dictionary or a flat list.
The keys of the dictionary should be references to the gate objects of
the circuit. For example:

.. code-block::  python

    c = Circuit(3, accelerators)
    g0 = gates.RX(0, theta=0)
    g1 = gates.RY(1, theta=0)
    g2 = gates.fSim(0, 2, theta=0, phi=0)
    c.add([g0, g1, gates.CZ(1, 2), g2, gates.H(2)])

    # set new values to the circuit's parameters using a dictionary
    params = {g0: 0.123, g1: 0.456, g2: (0.789, 0.321)]
    c.set_parameters(params)
    # equivalently the parameter's can be update with a list as
    params = [0.123, 0.456, (0.789, 0.321)]
    c.set_parameters(params)
    # or with a flat list as
    params = [0.123, 0.456, 0.789, 0.321]
    c.set_parameters(params)

If a list is given then its length and elements should be compatible with the
parametrized gates contained in the circuit. If a dictionary is given then its
keys should be all the parametrized gates in the circuit.

The following gates support parameter setting:

* ``RX``, ``RY``, ``RZ``, ``ZPow``, ``CZPow``: Accept a single ``theta`` parameter.
* :class:`qibo.base.gates.fSim`: Accepts a tuple of two parameters ``(theta, phi)``.
* :class:`qibo.base.gates.GeneralizedfSim`: Accepts a tuple of two parameters
  ``(unitary, phi)``. Here ``unitary`` should be a unitary matrix given as an
  array or ``tf.Tensor`` of shape ``(2, 2)``.
* :class:`qibo.base.gates.Unitary`: Accepts a single ``unitary`` parameter. This
  should be an array or ``tf.Tensor`` of shape ``(2, 2)``.
* :class:`qibo.base.gates.VariationalLayer`: Accepts a list of ``float``
  parameters with length compatible to the number of one qubit rotations implemented
  by the layer, for example:

.. code-block:: python

    c = Circuit(5)
    pairs = list((i, i + 1) for i in range(0, 4, 2))
    c.add(gates.VariationalLayer(range(nqubits), pairs,
                                 gates.RY, gates.CZ,
                                 params=np.zeros(5)))
    c.add((gates.RX(i, theta=0) for i in range(5)))

    # set random parameters to all rotations in the circuit
    c.set_parameters(np.random.random(10))
    # note that 10 numbers are used as the VariationalLayer contains five
    # rotations and five additional RX rotations are added afterwards.

Note that a ``np.ndarray`` or a ``tf.Tensor`` may also be used in the place of
a flat list.

Using :meth:`qibo.base.circuit.BaseCircuit.set_parameters` is more efficient than
recreating a new circuit with new parameter values.

.. _vqe-example:

How to write a VQE?
-------------------

The VQE requires an ansatz function and a ``Hamiltonian`` object.
There are examples of VQE optimization in ``examples/benchmarks``:

    - ``vqe.py``: a simple example with the XXZ model.

Here is a simple example using the Heisenberg XXZ model Hamiltonian:

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    from qibo import models, gates, hamiltonians

    nqubits = 6
    nlayers  = 4

    # Create variational circuit
    circuit = models.Circuit(nqubits)
    for l in range(nlayers):
        circuit.add((gates.RY(q, theta=0) for q in range(nqubits)))
        circuit.add((gates.CZ(q, q+1) for q in range(0, nqubits-1, 2)))
        circuit.add((gates.RY(q, theta=0) for q in range(nqubits)))
        circuit.add((gates.CZ(q, q+1) for q in range(1, nqubits-2, 2)))
        circuit.add(gates.CZ(0, nqubits-1))
    circuit.add((gates.RY(q, theta=0) for q in range(nqubits)))
    return circuit

    # Create XXZ Hamiltonian
    hamiltonian = hamiltonians.XXZ(nqubits=nqubits)
    # Create VQE model
    vqe = models.VQE(circuit, hamiltonian)

    # Optimize starting from a random guess for the variational parameters
    initial_parameters = np.random.uniform(0, 2*np.pi,
                                            2*nqubits*nlayers + nqubits)
    best, params = vqe.minimize(initial_parameters, method='BFGS')


For more information on the available options of the ``vqe.minimize`` call we
refer to the :ref:`Optimizers <Optimizers>` section of the documentation.
Note that if the Stochastic Gradient Descent optimizer is used then the user
has to use a backend based on tensorflow primitives and not the default custom
backend, as custom operators currently do not support automatic differentiation.
To switch the backend one can do ``qibo.set_backend("matmuleinsum")``.
Check the :ref:`How to use automatic differentiation? <autodiff-example>`
for more details.

A useful gate for defining the ansatz of the VQE is :class:`qibo.base.gates.VariationalLayer`.
This optimizes performance by fusing the layer of one-qubit parametrized gates with
the layer of two-qubit entangling gates and applying both as a single layer of
general two-qubit gates (as 4x4 matrices). The ansatz from the above example can
be written using :class:`qibo.base.gates.VariationalLayer` as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    circuit = models.Circuit(nqubits)
    pairs = list((i, i + 1) for i in range(0, nqubits - 1, 2))
    theta = np.zeros(nqubits)
    for l in range(nlayers):
        circuit.add(gates.VariationalLayer(range(nqubits), pairs,
                                           gates.RY, gates.CZ,
                                           theta, theta))
        circuit.add((gates.CZ(i, i + 1) for i in range(1, nqubits - 2, 2)))
        circuit.add(gates.CZ(0, nqubits - 1))
    circuit.add((gates.RY(i, theta) for i in range(nqubits)))
    return circuit


.. _qaoa-example:

How to use the QAOA?
--------------------

The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) was introduced in
`arXiv:1411.4028 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4028>`_ and is a prominent
algorithm for solving hard optimization problems using the circuit-based model
of quantum computation. Qibo provides an implementation of the QAOA as a model
that can be defined using a :class:`qibo.base.hamiltonians.Hamiltonian`. When
properly optimized, the QAOA ansatz will approximate the ground state of this
Hamiltonian. Here is a simple example using the Heisenberg XXZ Hamiltonian:

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    from qibo import models, hamiltonians

    # Create XXZ Hamiltonian for six qubits
    hamiltonian = hamiltonians.XXZ(6)
    # Create QAOA model
    qaoa = models.QAOA(hamiltonian)

    # Optimize starting from a random guess for the variational parameters
    initial_parameters = 0.01 * np.random.uniform(4)
    best_energy, final_parameters = qaoa.minimize(initial_parameters, method="BFGS")

In the above example the initial guess for parameters has length four and
therefore the QAOA ansatz consists of four operators, two using the
``hamiltonian`` and two using the mixer Hamiltonian. The user may specify the
mixer Hamiltonian when defining the QAOA model, otherwise
:class:`qibo.hamiltonians.X` will be used by default.
Note that the user may set the values of the variational parameters explicitly
using :meth:`qibo.models.QAOA.set_parameters`.
Similarly to the VQE, we refer to :ref:`Optimizers <Optimizers>` for more
information on the available options of the ``qaoa.minimize``.

QAOA uses the |++...+> as the default initial state on which the variational
operators are applied. The user may specify a different initial state when
executing or optimizing by passing the ``initial_state`` argument.

The QAOA model uses :ref:`Solvers <Solvers>` to apply the exponential operators
to the state vector. For more information on how solvers work we refer to the
:ref:`How to simulate time evolution? <timeevol-example>`.
As explained there, solvers will fall back to traditional Qibo circuits when a
:class:`qibo.base.hamiltonians.TrotterHamiltonian` is used instead of a
:class:`qibo.base.hamiltonians.Hamiltonian`. In this case it is also possible
to execute the QAOA circuit on multiple devices, by passing an ``accelerators``
dictionary when defining the model. For example the previous example would
have to be modified as:

.. code-block:: python

    hamiltonian = hamiltonians.XXZ(6, trotter=True)
    qaoa = models.QAOA(hamiltonian, accelerators={"/GPU:0": 1, "/GPU:1": 1})


.. _autodiff-example:

How to use automatic differentiation?
-------------------------------------

As a deep learning framework, Tensorflow supports
`automatic differentiation <https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/customization/autodiff>`_.
This can be used to optimize the parameters of variational circuits. For example
the following script optimizes the parameters of two rotations so that the circuit
output matches a target state, using the fidelity as figure of merit.

.. code-block:: python

    import tensorflow as tf
    # switch backend to "matmuleinsum" or "defaulteinsum"
    import qibo
    qibo.set_backend("matmuleinsum")
    from qibo.models import Circuit
    from qibo import gates

    nepochs = 100
    params = tf.Variable(np.zeros(2), dtype=tf.float64)
    optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
    target_state = tf.ones(4, dtype=tf.complex128) / 2.0

    for _ in range(nepochs):
        with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
            c = Circuit(2)
            c.add(RX(0, params[0]))
            c.add(RY(0, params[1]))
            fidelity = tf.math.real(tf.reduce_sum(tf.math.conj(target_state) * c()))
            loss = 1 - fidelity

        grads = tape.gradient(loss, params)
        optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, params))


Note that the circuit has to be defined inside the ``tf.GradientTape()`` otherwise
the calculated gradients will be ``None``. Also, a backend that uses tensorflow
primitives gates (either ``"matmuleinsum"`` or ``"defaulteinsum"``) has to be
used because currently the default ``"custom"`` backend does not support automatic
differentiation.

The optimization procedure can also be compiled as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    nepochs = 100
    params = tf.Variable(np.zeros(2), dtype=tf.float64)
    optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
    target_state = tf.ones(4, dtype=tf.complex128) / 2.0

    @tf.function
    def optimize(params):
        with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
            c = Circuit(2)
            c.add(RX(0, params[0]))
            c.add(RY(0, params[1]))
            fidelity = tf.math.real(tf.reduce_sum(tf.math.conj(target_state) * c()))
            loss = 1 - fidelity

        grads = tape.gradient(loss, params)
        optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, params))

    for _ in range(nepochs):
        optimize(params)

The user may also use ``tf.Variable`` and parametrized gates in any other way
that is supported by Tensorflow, such as defining
`custom Keras layers <https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/custom_layers_and_models>`_
and using the `Sequential model API <https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Sequential>`_
to train them.


How to perform noisy simulation?
--------------------------------

Qibo can perform noisy simulation using density matrices. ``Circuit`` objects can
evolve density matrices in a similar manner to state vectors. In order to use
density matrices the user should execute the circuit passing a density matrix as
the initial state. For example

.. code-block:: python

    import qibo
    # switch backend to "matmuleinsum" or "defaulteinsum"
    qibo.set_backend("matmuleinsum")
    from qibo import models, gates

    # Define circuit
    c = models.Circuit(2)
    c.add(gates.H(0))
    c.add(gates.H(1))

    # Define initial density matrix as `rho = |00><00|`
    state = np.zeros(4)
    state[0] = 1
    initial_rho = np.outer(state, state.conj())

    # Call circuit on the density matrix
    final_rho = c(initial_rho)
    # final_rho will be tf.eye(4) / 4 which corresponds to |++><++|

will perform the transformation

.. math::
    |00 \rangle \langle 00| \rightarrow (H_1 \otimes H_2)|00 \rangle \langle 00|(H_1 \otimes H_2)^\dagger = |++ \rangle \langle ++|

Note that the calculation backend was switched to ``"matmuleinsum"`` because the
default ``"custom"`` backend does not support density matrices.

The user can simulate noise using :class:`qibo.base.gates.NoiseChannel`.
If this or any other channel is used in a ``Circuit``, then the execution will automatically
switch to density matrices. For example

.. code-block:: python

    from qibo import models, gates

    c = models.Circuit(2) # starts with state |00>
    c.add(gates.X(1)) # transforms |00> -> |01>
    c.add(gates.NoiseChannel(0, px=0.3)) # transforms |01> -> (1 - px)|01><01| + px |11><11|
    final_state = c()
    # will return tf.Tensor(diag([0, 0.7, 0, 0.3]))

will perform the transformation

.. math::
    |00\rangle & \rightarrow (I \otimes X)|00\rangle = |01\rangle
    \\& \rightarrow 0.7|01\rangle \langle 01| + 0.3(X\otimes I)|01\rangle \langle 01|(X\otimes I)^\dagger
    \\& = 0.7|01\rangle \langle 01| + 0.3|11\rangle \langle 11|

Note that ``Circuit`` will use state vectors until the first channel is found and will
switch to density matrices for the rest of the simulation. Measurements and
callbacks can be used exactly as in the pure state vector case.

In practical applications noise typically occurs after every gate. For this reason,
:class:`qibo.base.circuit.BaseCircuit` provides a ``.with_noise()`` method
which automatically creates a new circuit that contains a noise channel after
every normal gate. The user can control the probabilities of the noise channel
using a noise map, which is a dictionary that maps qubits to the corresponding
noise probability triplets.

For example, the following script

.. code-block:: python

      from qibo.models import Circuit
      from qibo import gates

      c = Circuit(2)
      c.add([gates.H(0), gates.H(1), gates.CNOT(0, 1)])

      # Define a noise map that maps qubit IDs to noise probabilities
      noise_map = {0: (0.1, 0.0, 0.2), 1: (0.0, 0.2, 0.1)}
      noisy_c = c.with_noise(noise_map)

will create a new circuit ``noisy_c`` that is equivalent to:

.. code-block:: python

      noisy_c2 = Circuit(2)
      noisy_c2.add(gates.H(0))
      noisy_c2.add(gates.NoiseChannel(0, 0.1, 0.0, 0.2))
      noisy_c2.add(gates.NoiseChannel(1, 0.0, 0.2, 0.1))
      noisy_c2.add(gates.H(1))
      noisy_c2.add(gates.NoiseChannel(0, 0.1, 0.0, 0.2))
      noisy_c2.add(gates.NoiseChannel(1, 0.0, 0.2, 0.1))
      noisy_c2.add(gates.CNOT(0, 1))
      noisy_c2.add(gates.NoiseChannel(0, 0.1, 0.0, 0.2))
      noisy_c2.add(gates.NoiseChannel(1, 0.0, 0.2, 0.1))

Note however that the circuit ``noisy_c`` that was created using the
``with_noise`` method uses the gate objects of the original circuit ``c``
(it is not a deep copy), unlike ``noisy_c2`` where each gate was created as
a new object.

The user may use a single tuple instead of a dictionary as the noise map
In this case the same probabilities will be applied to all qubits.
That is ``noise_map = (0.1, 0.0, 0.1)`` is equivalent to
``noise_map = {0: (0.1, 0.0, 0.1), 1: (0.1, 0.0, 0.1), ...}``.

Moreover, ``with_noise`` supports an additional optional argument ``measurement_noise``
which allows the user to explicitly specify the noise probabilities.
before measurement gates. These may be different from the typical noise probabilities
depending on the experimental realization of measurements. For example:

.. code-block:: python

      from qibo.models import Circuit
      from qibo import gates

      c = Circuit(2)
      c.add([gates.H(0), gates.H(1)])
      c.add(gates.M(0))

      # Define a noise map that maps qubit IDs to noise probabilities
      noise_map = {0: (0.1, 0.0, 0.2), 1: (0.0, 0.2, 0.1)}
      measurement_noise = (0.4, 0.0, 0.0)
      noisy_c = c.with_noise(noise_map, measurement_noise=measurement_noise)

is equivalent to the following:

.. code-block:: python

      noisy_c = Circuit(2)
      noisy_c.add(gates.H(0))
      noisy_c.add(gates.NoiseChannel(0, 0.1, 0.0, 0.2))
      noisy_c.add(gates.NoiseChannel(1, 0.0, 0.2, 0.1))
      noisy_c.add(gates.H(1))
      noisy_c.add(gates.NoiseChannel(0, 0.4, 0.0, 0.0))
      noisy_c.add(gates.NoiseChannel(1, 0.0, 0.2, 0.1))
      noisy_c.add(gates.M(0))

Note that ``measurement_noise`` does not affect qubits that are not measured
and the default ``noise_map`` will be used for those.

Similarly to ``noise_map``, ``measurement_noise`` can either be either a
dictionary that maps each qubit to the corresponding probability triplet or
a tuple if the same triplet shall be used on all measured qubits.

How to simulate time evolution?
-------------------------------

Simulating the unitary time evolution of quantum states is useful in many
physics applications including the simulation of adiabatic quantum computation.
Qibo provides the :class:`qibo.models.StateEvolution` model that simulates
unitary evolution using the full state vector. For example:

.. code-block::  python

    import numpy as np
    from qibo import hamiltonians, models

    # Define evolution model under the non-interacting sum(Z) Hamiltonian
    # with time step dt=1e-1
    nqubits = 4
    evolve = models.StateEvolution(hamiltonians.Z(nqubits), dt=1e-1)
    # Define initial state as |++++>
    initial_state = np.ones(2 ** nqubits) / np.sqrt(2 ** nqubits)
    # Get the final state after time t=2
    final_state = evolve(final_time=2, initial_state=initial_state)


When studying dynamics people are usually interested not only in the final state
vector but also observing how physical quantities change during the time
evolution. This is possible using callbacks. For example, in the above case we
can track how <X> changes as follows:

.. code-block::  python

    from qibo import callbacks
    # Define a callback that calculates the energy (expectation value) of the X Hamiltonian
    observable = callbacks.Energy(hamiltonians.X(nqubits))
    # Create evolution object using the above callback and a time step of dt=1e-3
    evolve = models.StateEvolution(hamiltonians.Z(nqubits), dt=1e-3,
                                   callbacks=[observable])
    # Evolve for total time t=1
    final_state = evolve(final_time=1, initial_state=initial_state)

    print(observable[:])
    # will print a ``tf.Tensor`` of shape ``(1001,)`` that holds <X>(t) values


Note that the time step ``dt=1e-3`` defines how often we calculate <X> during
the evolution.

In the above cases the exact time evolution operator (exponential of the Hamiltonian)
was used to evolve the state vector. Because the evolution Hamiltonian is
time-independent, the matrix exponentiation happens only once. It is possible to
simulate time-dependent Hamiltonians by passing a function of time instead of
a :class:`qibo.base.hamiltonians.Hamiltonian` in the
:class:`qibo.models.StateEvolution` model. For example:

.. code-block::  python

    import numpy as np
    from qibo import hamiltonians, models

    # Defina a time dependent Hamiltonian
    nqubits = 4
    ham = lambda t: np.cos(t) * hamiltonians.Z(nqubits)
    # and pass it to the evolution model
    evolve = models.StateEvolution(ham, dt=1e-3)
    final_state = evolve(final_time=1, initial_state=initial_state)


The above script will still use the exact time evolution operator with the
exponentiation repeated for each time step. The integration method can
be changed using the ``solver`` argument when executing. The solvers that are
currently implemented are the default exponential solver (``"exp"``) and two
Runge-Kutta solvers: fourth-order (``"rk4"``) and fifth-order (``"rk45"``).


Using Trotter decomposition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Trotter decomposition provides a way to represent the unitary evolution of
quantum states as a sequence of two qubit unitaries. This allows to represent
the physical process of time evolution as a quantum circuit. Qibo provides
functionality to perform this transformation if the underlying Hamiltonian is
defined as a sum of commuting parts that consist of terms that can be
exponentiated efficiently. Such Hamiltonian can be implemented in Qibo using
the :class:`qibo.base.hamiltonians.TrotterHamiltonian`, which is based in Sec.
4.1 of `arXiv:1901.05824 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.05824>`_. Bellow is an
example of how to use this object in practice:

.. code-block::  python

    import numpy as np
    from qibo import hamiltonians, matrices

    # Create a two-qubit term for the cirtical TFIM model
    matrix = -np.kron(matrices.Z, matrices.Z) - np.kron(matrices.X, matrices.I)
    term = hamiltonians.Hamiltonian(2, matrix)
    # define the even and odd parts of the total Hamiltonian for 5 qubits
    # periodic boundary conditions are assumed
    even = {(0, 1): term, (2, 3): term, (4, 0): term}
    odd = {(1, 2): term, (3, 4): term}
    # create the ``TrotterHamiltonian`` using these terms
    ham = hamiltonians.TrotterHamiltonian(even, odd)

    # alternatively one can use the ``from_twoqubit_term`` convenience method
    # which works for translationally invariant Hamiltonians
    ham = hamiltonians.TrotterHamiltonian.from_twoqubit_term(nqubits=5, term=term)

    # or one can use the pre-coded TFIM model enabling the ``trotter`` flag
    ham = hamiltonians.TFIM(nqubits=5, trotter=True)

    # once the Hamiltonian is created we can get the Trotter circuit that
    # implements a single time step ``dt``
    circuit = ham.circuit(dt=1e-2)

This is a standard :class:`qibo.tensorflow.circuit.TensorflowCircuit` that
contains :class:`qibo.base.gates.Unitary` gates corresponding to the
exponentials of the Trotter decomposition and can be executed on any state.

A :class:`qibo.base.hamiltonians.TrotterHamiltonian` can also be used to
simulate time evolution. This can be done by passing the Hamiltonian to a
:class:`qibo.evolution.StateEvolution` model and using the exponential solver.
Qibo automatically finds that this Hamiltonian can be Trotterized and uses this
to perform the evolution. For example:

.. code-block::  python

    from qibo import models, hamiltonians

    nqubits = 5
    # Create a critical TFIM Hamiltonian as ``TrotterHamiltonian``
    ham = hamiltonians.TFIM(nqubits=nqubits, h=1.0, trotter=True)
    # Define the |+++++> initial state
    initial_state = np.ones(2 ** nqubits) / np.sqrt(2 ** nqubits)
    # Define the evolution model
    evolve = models.StateEvolution(ham, dt=1e-3)
    # Evolve for total time T=1
    final_state = evolve(final_time=1, initial_state=initial_state)

This script creates the Trotter circuit for ``dt=1e-3`` and applies it
repeatedly to the given initial state T / dt = 1000 times to obtain the
final state of the evolution.

Since Trotter evolution is based on Qibo circuits, it also supports distributed
execution on multiple devices. This can be enabled by passing an
``accelerators`` dictionary when defining the
:class:`qibo.evolution.StateEvolution` model. Check the
:ref:`How to select hardware devices? <gpu-examples>` example for more details.


How to simulate adiabatic time evolution?
-----------------------------------------

Qibo provides the :class:`qibo.models.AdiabaticEvolution` model to simulate
adiabatic time evolution. This is a special case of the
:class:`qibo.models.StateEvolution` model analyzed in the previous example
where the evolution Hamiltonian is interpolated between an initial "easy"
Hamiltonian and a "hard" Hamiltonian that usually solves an optimization problem.
Here is an example of adiabatic evolution simulation:

.. code-block::  python

    import numpy as np
    from qibo import hamiltonians, models

    nqubits = 4
    T = 1 # total evolution time
    # Define the easy and hard Hamiltonians
    h0 = hamiltonians.X(nqubits)
    h1 = hamiltonians.TFIM(nqubits, h=0)
    # Define the interpolation scheduling
    s = lambda t: t
    # Define evolution model
    evolve = models.AdiabaticEvolution(h0, h1, s, solver="rk4")
    # Evolve using the Runge-Kutta solver to get the final state
    final_state = evolve(final_time=T)


According to the adiabatic theorem, for proper scheduling and total evolution
time the ``final_state`` should approximate the ground state of the "hard"
Hamiltonian.

If the initial state is not specified, the ground state of the easy Hamiltonian
will be used, which is common for adiabatic evolution. A distributed execution
can be used by passing an ``accelerators`` dictionary during the initialization
of the ``AdiabaticEvolution`` model. In this case the default initial state is
|++...+> (full superposition in the computational basis).

Callbacks may also be used as in the previous example. An additional callback
(:class:`qibo.tensorflow.callbacks.Gap`) is available for calculating the
energies and the gap of the adiabatic evolution Hamiltonian. Its usage is
similar to other callbacks:

.. code-block::  python

    # define a callback for calculating the ground state energy
    ground = callbacks.Gap(mode=0)
    # define a callback for calculating the gap
    gap = callbacks.Gap()
    # define and execute the ``AdiabaticEvolution`` model
    evolution = AdiabaticEvolution(h0, h1, lambda t: t, dt=1e-1,
                                   callbacks=[gap, ground])
    final_state = evolution(final_time=1.0)
    # print the values of the gap at each evolution time step
    print(gap[:])


The scheduling function ``s`` should be a callable that accepts one (s(t)) or
two (s(t, p)) arguments. The first argument accepts values in [0, 1] and
corresponds to the ratio ``t / final_time`` during evolution. The second
optional argument is a vector of free parameters that can be optimized. The
function should, by definition, satisfy the properties s(0, p) = 0 and
s(1, p) = 1 for any p, otherwise errors will be raised.

The state evolution functionality described in the previous example can also be
used for simulating adiabatic evolution. The solver can be specified during the
initialization of the :class:`qibo.models.AdiabaticEvolution` model and a
Trotter decomposition may be used with the exponential solver. The Trotter
decomposition will be used automatically if ``h0`` and ``h1`` are defined
using the :class:`qibo.base.hamiltonians.TrotterHamiltonian` object. For
pre-coded Hamiltonians this can be done simply as

.. code-block::  python

    h0 = hamiltonians.X(nqubits, trotter=True)
    h1 = hamiltonians.TFIM(nqubits, h=0, trotter=True)


Note that ``h0`` and ``h1`` should have the same type, either both
:class:`qibo.base.hamiltonians.Hamiltonian` or both
:class:`qibo.base.hamiltonians.TrotterHamiltonian`. When Trotter evolution is
used, it is also possible to execute on multiple devices by passing an
``accelerators`` dictionary in the creation of the
:class:`qibo.evolution.AdiabaticEvolution` model.


Optimizing the scheduling function
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The free parameters ``p`` of the scheduling function can be optimized using
the :meth:`qibo.evolution.AdiabaticEvolution.minimize` method. The parameters
are optimized so that the final state of the adiabatic evolution approximates
the ground state of the "hard" Hamiltonian. Optimization is similar to what is
described in the :ref:`How to write a VQE? <vqe-example>` example and can be
done as follows:

.. code-block::  python

    # Define Hamiltonians
    h0 = hamiltonians.X(3)
    h1 = hamiltonians.TFIM(3)
    # Define scheduling function with a free variational parameter ``p``
    sp = lambda t, p: (1 - p) * np.sqrt(t) + p * t
    # Define an evolution model with dt=1e-2
    evolution = models.AdiabaticEvolution(h0, h1, sp, dt=1e-2)
    # Find the optimal value for ``p`` starting from ``p = 0.5`` and ``T=1``.
    initial_guess = [0.5, 1]
    best, params = evolution.minimize(initial_guess, method="BFGS", options={'disp': True})
    print(best) # prints the best energy <H1> found from the final state
    print(params) # prints the optimal values for the parameters.

Note that the ``minimize`` method optimizes both the free parameters ``p`` of
the scheduling function as well as the total evolution time. The initial guess
for the total evolution time should be the last value of the given
``initial_guess`` array.
