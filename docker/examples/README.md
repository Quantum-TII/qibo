# Advanced examples

In this folder we present some examples of quantum circuits applied to specific
physics problems.

- [Scaling of variational quantum circuit depth for condensed matter systems](aavqe/README.md)
- [Groverâ€™s Algorithm for solving Satisfiability Problems](grover3sat/README.md)
- [Data reuploading for a universal quantum classifier](reuploading_classifier/README.md)
- [Quantum unary approach to option pricing](unary/README.md)
- [Measuring the tangle of three-qubit states](3_tangle/README.md)
- [Quantum Singular Value Decomposer](qsvd/README.md)

In the `benchmarks` folder we have included examples concerning:
- Variational Quantum Eigensolver (`benchmarks/vqe.py`)
- A generic benchmark script for multiple circuits (`benchmarks/main.py`)
